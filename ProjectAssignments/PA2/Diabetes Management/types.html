                  <h1>Type 1</h1>
                  <p>Type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and kills the beta cells of the pancreas. No, or very little, insulin is released into the body.
                  As a result, sugar builds up in the blood instead of being used as energy. About five to 10 per cent of people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes.
                  Type 1 diabetes generally develops in childhood or adolescence, but can develop in adulthood.</p>
                  <p>Type 1 diabetes is always treated with insulin. Meal planning also helps with keeping blood sugar at the right levels.</p>
                  <p>Type 1 diabetes also includes latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA),
                  the term used to describe the small number of people with apparent type 2 diabetes who appear to have immune-mediated loss of pancreatic beta cells.</p>
                  <p>Treatment for type 1 diabetes includes</p>
                	<ul>
                		<li>taking shots, also called injections, of insulin.</li>
                		<li>sometimes taking medicines by mouth.</li>
                		<li>making healthy food choices.</li>
                		<li>being physically active.</li>
                		<li>controlling your blood pressure levels. Blood pressure is the force of blood flow inside your blood vessels.</li>
                		<li>controlling your cholesterol levels. Cholesterol is a type of fat in your body’s cells, in your blood, and in many foods.</li>
                	</ul>

                  <h1>Type 2</h1>
                  <p>Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body can’t properly use the insulin that is released (called insulin insensitivity) or does not make enough insulin.
                  As a result, sugar builds up in the blood instead of being used as energy. About 90 per cent of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes.
                  Type 2 diabetes more often develops in adults, but children can be affected.</p>
                  <p>Depending on the severity of type 2 diabetes, it may be managed through physical activity and meal planning, or may also require medications
                  and/or insulin to control blood sugar more effectively.</p>
                  <p>Treatment for type 2 diabetes includes</p>
                	<ul>
                		<li>using diabetes medicines</li>
                		<li>making healthy food choices</li>
                		<li>being physically active</li>
                		<li>controlling your blood pressure levels</li>
                		<li>controlling your cholesterol levels</li>
                	</ul>
                  <h1>Gestational Diabetes</h1>
                  <p>A third type of diabetes, gestational diabetes, is a temporary condition that occurs during pregnancy. It affects approximately two to four per cent of all pregnancies
                  (in the non-Aboriginal population) and involves an increased risk of developing diabetes for both mother and child.</p>
