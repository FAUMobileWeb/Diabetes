This is our Balsamiq Storyboard. We are doing Diabetes Management. So in a rough draft of the project we have come up with a
storyboard that will at least give a rough image about how our site will look like on a mobile site. First we have out login page in 
which any user can enter there username and password to login to there own personal profile. In this profile page they will have
a set of links that will lead them to different parts of the site. The first will be the food entries. In which the user can enter
breakfast,lunch,dinner and snacks that they will be able to track on a daily or weekly basis. Next is a weight tracker, like the food
entries the user can enter there weight on a daily or weekly basis to see if there own weight is changing dramatically. The last two 
pages will be a general information page. Which will give out information regarding the Can's and Can Not's of foods, and also 
the last page will be the general information about the Types of Diabetes: Type 1 and Type 2.
